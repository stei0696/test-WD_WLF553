From former README when this repository was originally for final project but had since moved to Marina's Research folder:
Description: This project is to implement data management techniques learned in WLF 553 Reproducible Data Science for Marina Steiner’s Master’s thesis project data. The overall goal of the research project is described as follows: 
To obtain more detailed information about the historical environmental sampling results and understand potential health risk associated with these values, this research proposes to digitize the paper records of the water sampling data. Digitizing the existing water monitoring data into an accessible database will enable partners to obtain temporal (seasonal and annual) and spatial trends in water quality over time, potentially identifying whether exposure levels correlate with the agricultural seasons, climate patterns, increasing water scarcity, and geographic location.
